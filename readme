Mitch: working on
-- add pitfall detection so mr. death does not just get stuck in pits

Olivia: working on enemies 
-- collision checks are working, MrDeath loses health when he has body contact with the knight. 
Problems and TODOs:
-- how to detect whether the sword is touching him? how to detect whether his seith is chopping the knight?
-- losing health/death animation for MrDeath
-- clear out the knight after it dies 
-- need a list of knights in Level mapped to the spawn points on tile map
